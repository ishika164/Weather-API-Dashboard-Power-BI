# 🌦 Weather API Dashboard - Power BI

An **interactive, real-time Weather + Air Quality Dashboard** built using **Power BI** and integrated with the **OpenWeatherMap API**.  
This project visualizes live weather conditions and air quality insights in a clean, dynamic dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to **analyze and visualize real-time weather and air quality data** in an interactive dashboard, enabling users to:
- Monitor live weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed, pressure).
- Track and compare **Air Quality Index (AQI)** for multiple pollutants.  
- View **7-day weather forecasts** for decision-making and planning.  
- Provide **city-level insights** with dynamic selection and real-time data refresh.  
- Demonstrate **REST API integration with Power BI** for real-time analytics use cases.  

This project highlights how API-driven automation and data storytelling can be applied to real-world scenarios using Power BI.
